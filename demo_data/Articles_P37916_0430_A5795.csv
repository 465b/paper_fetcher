Accordingly, knowledge on storm surge monitoring has progressed significantly in recent years, and this review, focused on monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of storm surges, responds to the need for a synthesis. Three main components are presented in the review: (1) monitoring storm surges from the viewpoint of three effective approaches; (2) understanding the challenges faced by the three monitoring approaches to increase our awareness of monitoring storm surges; (3) identifying three research priorities and orientations to provide new ideas in future storm surge monitoring. From the perspective of monitoring approaches, recent progress was achieved with respect to tide gauges, satellite altimetry and numerical simulation. Storm surge events can nowadays be identified accurately, and the surge heights can be calculated based on long-term tide gauge observations. The changing frequency and intensity of storm surge activity, combined with statistical analysis and climatology, can be used to enable a better understanding of the possible regional or global long-term trends. Compared with tidal observation data, satellite altimetry has the advantage of providing offshore sea level information to an accuracy of 10 cm. In addition, satellite altimetry can provide more effective observations for studying storm surges, such as transient surge data of the deep ocean. Simultaneously, the study of storm surges via numerical simulation has been further developed, mainly reflected in the gradual improvement of simulation accuracy but also in the refinement of comprehensive factors affecting storm surge activity. However, from the above approaches, storm surge activity monitoring cannot fully reflect the spatial and temporal variability of storm surges, especially the spatial changes at a regional or global scale. In particular, compared to global storm surge, tide gauges and satellite altimeters are relatively sparse, and the spatial distribution is extremely uneven, which often seriously restricts the overall understanding of the spatial distribution features of storm surge activity. Numerical models can be used as a tool to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings for storm surge monitoring, as they provide real-time spatiotemporal features of storm surge events. But long-term numerical hindcast of tides and surges requires an extremely high computational effort. Considering the shortcomings of the above approaches and the impact of climate change, there is no clear approach to remedy the framework for studying the spatial and temporal characteristics of global or regional storm surge activity at a climatic scale. Therefore, we show how new insights or techniques are useful for the monitoring of future crises. This work is especially important in planning efforts by policymakers, coastal managers, civil protection managers and the general public to adapt to climate change and rising sea levels.",0.807

Although many efforts have been undertaken linking climatic and stock dynamic factors to herring recruitment, no major attempt has been made to estimate recruitment levels before the 20th century. Here, we present a novel annually resolved, absolutely dated herring recruitment reconstruction, derived from stable carbon isotope geochemistry (delta C-13), from ocean quahog shells from the Fladen Ground (northern North Sea). Our age model is based on a growth increment chronology obtained from fourteen shells. Ten of these were micromilled at annual resolution for delta C-13 analysis. Our results indicate that the anthropogenically driven relative depletion of C-13, the oceanic Suess effect (oSE), became evident in the northern North Sea in the 1850s. We calculated a regression line between the oSE-detrended delta C-13 results (delta C-13(S)over dot and diatom abundance in the North Sea, the regression being mediated by the effect of phytoplankton on the delta C-13 of the ambient dissolved inorganic carbon. We used this regression to build an equation mediated by a nutritional link to reconstruct herring recruitment using delta C-13(S)over dot . The reconstruction suggests that there were five extended episodes of low-recruitment levels before the 20th century. These results are supported by measured recruitment estimates and historical fish catch and export documentation. This work demonstrates that molluscan sclerochronological records can contribute to the investigation of ecological baselines and ecosystem functioning impacted by anthropogenic activity with implications for conservation and stock management.",0.699

The American razor clam Ensis leei was introduced into the Wadden Sea by vessels in the late 1970s and has since spread widely. It has been suggested that Ensis does not interact strongly with other benthic species. The abundance and biomass of E. leei were recorded in 2393 samples in the north-eastern Wadden Sea and 800 samples in the south-eastern Wadden Sea over a total period of 9 years. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we developed a habitat prediction model using sedimentological and hydrodynamic predictors to help understand the shape of the ecological niche occupied by Ensis in the Wadden Sea. Our model showed that Ensis preferred areas with moderately high bed shear stress and prolonged or constant water coverage. Ensis preferred coarse sediments in the northern sub-area but coarse and muddy sediments in the southern sub-area and was negatively affected by the sand mason worm Lanice conchilega in the northern sub-area. Predictions of the spatial distribution of Ensis using the northern and southern datasets revealed major differences in predicted hot-spots throughout the entire study site. This study thus highlights the need to collect a sufficiently large dataset from different sub-areas of the Wadden Sea to allow valid conclusions to be drawn regarding the spatial distribution of Ensis. The negative effects of L. conchilega on Ensis abundance and biomass as well as the occurrence of Ensis in muddy sediments in the south suggest that the ecological niche of this neobiotic species is likely to overlap partly with the native fauna of the Wadden Sea.",0.457

This study therefore optimized and validated a Speedisk (R) based SPE and LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS method to tackle the challenge of measuring the expected ultra-trace concentrations in seawater. This method was applied to 18 samples collected at different locations in the open sea and harbor of the BPNS. Forty-eight compounds, among which several pharmaceuticals, personal care products or pesticides described in the EU Watchlist, were detected - some for the first time in seawater - at concentrations ranging up to 156 ng L-1. Moreover, the untargeted screening potential of the newly developed HRMS method was highlighted by revealing the presence of up to 1300 unknown components in a single sample and by assigning molecular formulae to those components demonstrating high discriminative potential between samples.",0.671

Phylogenetic analyses from sequences of the plastid encoded tufA gene confirmed that U. compressa is abundant along the German Baltic Sea and North Sea coasts. We were able to genetically confirm the presence of U. compressa in the Baltic Sea below salinities of 15 PSU. However, we detected morphologies agreeing with the attached and branched tubular type material only in the North Sea, while U. compressa on Baltic Sea coasts indiscriminately exhibited a very distinct morphology of sheet-like thalli that were always unattached, with the exception of one collection site. Drifting forms were also frequently detected in the Wadden Sea, but not on the island of Helgoland. The tufA sequences of attached and tubular forms of U. compressa from the German Wadden Sea were identical to the drifting sheets found in the Wadden and Baltic Seas and the sequence divergence was extremely small at <= 0.9%. The proliferating, blade-like thalli of U. compressa appear as a nuisance ecotype that is able to form massive accumulations associated with oxygen depletion. Mass accumulations were observed to cause severe damage and increased mortality of habitat forming Zostera and Ruppia populations.",0.428

This is an issue of major environmental relevance, as many ecosystems have experienced changes in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) due to anthropogenic manipulation of nutrient loading. To understand how changes in N and P limitation may impact community structure, we conducted laboratory competition experiments using a multispecies phytoplankton community sampled from the North Sea. Results showed that picocyanobacteria (Cyanobium sp.) won the competition under N limitation, while picocyanobacteria and nonmotile nanophytoplankton (Nannochloropsis sp.) coexisted at equal abundances under P limitation. Additional experiments using isolated monocultures confirmed that Cyanobium sp. depleted N to lower levels than Nannochloropsis sp., but that both species had nearly identical P requirements, suggesting a potential for neutral coexistence under P-limited conditions. Pairwise competition experiments with the two isolates seemed to support the consistency of these results, but P limitation resulted in stable species coexistence irrespective of the initial conditions rather than the random drift of species abundances predicted by neutral theory. Comparison of the light absorption spectra indicates that coexistence of the two species was stabilized through differential use of the underwater light spectrum. Our results provide an interesting experimental example of modern coexistence theory, where species were equal competitors in one niche dimension but their competitive traits differed in other niche dimensions, thus enabling stable species coexistence on a single limiting nutrient through niche differentiation in the light spectrum.",0.528

R.","Foreshore litter data from a UK citizen-science programme, combined with OSPAR data, were analysed for possible spatial patterns around Scottish and North Sea coastlines. Loading distributions were positively skewed, and statistics commensurate with such distributions were used. When considering coast type, litter loadings on Scottish harbour and river foreshores were influenced by local litter sources. When considering exposure to the predominant westerly winds over Scotland, litter loadings on the west coast (i.e. predominant onshore winds) were greater on foreshores on open coasts compared to those within embayments. The opposite was true for the Scottish east coast (i.e. predominantly offshore winds). The north east coast of the UK appeared to have an organised pattern of plastic litter loading, increasing in magnitude (median) and spread (inter quartile range) in the direction of the coastal flow. Four other coastal segments with similar patterns were suggested from the west of Scotland to Denmark.",0.660

E. Markus","An ensemble of regional climate change scenarios for the North Sea is validated and analyzed. Five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) using three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) have been downscaled with the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean model RCA4-NEMO. Validation of sea surface temperature (SST) against different datasets suggests that the model results are well within the spread of observational datasets. The ensemble mean SST with a bias of less than 1 C is the solution that fits the observations best and underlines the importance of ensemble modeling. The exchange of momentum, heat, and freshwater between atmosphere and ocean in the regional, coupled model compares well with available datasets. The climatological seasonal cycles of these fluxes are within the 95% confidence limits of the datasets. Towards the end of the 21st century the projected North Sea SST increases by 1.5 C (RCP 4.5), and 4 C (RCP 8.5), respectively. Under this change the North Sea develops a specific pattern of the climate change signal for the air-sea temperature difference and latent heat flux in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 8.5 scenario the amplitude of the spatial heat flux anomaly increases to 5 W/m at the end of the century. Different hypotheses are discussed that could contribute to the spatially non-uniform change in air-sea interaction. The most likely cause for an increased latent heat loss in the central western North Sea is a drier atmosphere towards the end of the century. Drier air in the lee of the British Isles affects the balance of the surface heat budget of the North Sea. This effect is an example of how regional characteristics modulate global climate change. For climate change projections on regional scales it is important to resolve processes and feedbacks at regional scales.",0.306
9362836,https://sysrev.com/p/37916/article/9362836,Centennial decline in North Sea water clarity causes strong delay in phytoplankton bloom timing,Global Change Biology,"Opdal, Anders Frugard; Lindemann, Christian; Aksnes, Dag L.","With climate warming, a widespread expectation is that events in spring, such as flowering, bird migrations, and insect bursts, will occur earlier because of increasing temperature. At high latitudes, increased ocean temperature is suggested to advance the spring phytoplankton bloom due to earlier stabilization of the water column. However, climate warming is also expected to cause browning in lakes and rivers due to increases in terrestrial greening, ultimately reducing water clarity in coastal areas where freshwater drain. In shallow areas, decreased retention of sediments on the seabed will add to this effect. Both browning and resuspension of sediments imply a reduction of the euphotic zone and Sverdrup's critical depth leading to a delay in the spring bloom, counteracting the effect of increasing temperature. Here, we provide evidence that such a transparency reduction has already taken place in both the deep and shallow areas of the North Sea during the 20th century. A sensitivity analysis using a water column model suggests that the reduced transparency might have caused up to 3 weeks delay in the spring bloom over the last century. This delay stands in contrast to the earlier bloom onset expected from global warming, thus highlighting the importance of including changing water transparency in analyses of phytoplankton phenology and primary production. This appears to be of particular relevance for coastal waters, where increased concentrations of absorbing and scattering substances (sediments, dissolved organic matter) have been suggested to lead to coastal darkening.",0.554

Huber, 2015) has successfully spread throughout North Sea coasts from Spain to Norway and the United Kingdom to the western Baltic. We investigated the distribution and abundance of this non-indigenous bivalve species as a potential novel food resource for common scoter Melanitta nigra (Linnaeus, 1758) along the eastern German North Sea coast. Highest densities of flightless moulting and wintering common scoters coincided with areas of high E. leei abundance. Other European studies showed common scoters extensively feed on E. leei. Even with these findings, it remains difficult to demonstrate convincingly that E. leei constitutes a major food source for common scoter in the German North Sea during their non-breeding season. However, our study suggests that E. leei has become an important prey item for internationally important concentrations of common scoters at large spatial scales.",0.388

Benthic species play an important role in benthic-pelagic coupling, such as through the remineralization of deposited organic material, and changes to benthic community structure and diversity have associated with changes in ecosystem functioning, ecosystem stability and resilience. However, the long-term variability of traits and functions in benthic communities is largely unknown. By using abundance and bioturbation potential of macrofauna samples, taken along a transect from the German Bight towards the Dogger Bank in May 1990 and annually from 1995 to 2017, we analysed the taxonomic and trait-based macrofauna long-term community variability and diversity. Taxonomic and trait-based diversity remained stable over time, while three different regimes were found, characterised by changes in taxonomic and trait-based community structure. Min/max autocorrelation factor analysis revealed the climatic variables sea surface temperature (SST) and North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), nitrite, and epibenthic abundance as most important environmental drivers for taxonomic and trait-based community changes.",0.633

Anouk; Nauta, Reinier; Markovic, Mirjana; Buschbaum, Christian; Folmer, Eelke O.; Luttikhuizen, Pieternella C.; van der Meer, Jaap; Waser, Andreas M.; Wegner, K. Mathias; Thieltges, David W.","There are surprisingly few field studies on the role of invasive species on parasite infection patterns in native hosts. We investigated the role of invasive Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) in determining parasite infection levels in native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in relation to other environmental and biotic factors. Using hierarchical field sampling covering three spatial scales along a large intertidal ecosystem (European Wadden Sea), we found strong spatial differences in infection levels of five parasite species associated with mussels and oysters. We applied mixed models to analyse the associations between parasite prevalence and abundance in mussels and oysters, and 12 biological and environmental factors. For each parasite-host relationship, an optimal model (either a null, one-factor or two-factor model) was selected based on AIC scores. We found that the density of invasive oysters contributed to three of the 12 models. Other biological factors such as host size (six models), and the density of target or alternative host species (five models) contributed more frequently to the best models. Furthermore, for parasite species infecting both mussels and oysters, parasite population densities were higher in native mussels, attributed to the higher densities of mussels. Our results indicate that invasive species can affect parasite infection patterns in native species in the field, but that their relative contribution may be further mediated by other biological and environmental parameters. These results stress the usefulness of large-scale field studies for detailed assessments of the mechanisms underlying the impacts of invasive species on native host communities.",0.701

This approach is tested for general application in cold marine regions (freezing to 5 degrees C). We used amplicon sequencing and qPCR to quantify 16S rRNA and GyrB genes from oleophilic bacteria in seawater samples from two different crude oil enrichments. The first experiment was conducted in a controlled environment using laboratory conditions and natural North Sea fjord seawater (NSC) at a constant temperature of 5 degrees C. The second was performed in the field with natural Arctic seawater (ARC) and outdoor temperature conditions from -7 degrees C to around 4 degrees C. Although the experimental conditions for NSC and ARC differed, the temporal changes in bacterial communities were comparable and reflected oil biotransformation processes. The common bacterial OTUs for NSC and ARC had the highest identity to Colwellia rossensis and Oleispira antarctica rRNA sequences and were enriched within a few days in both conditions. Other typical oil degrading bacteria such as Alcanivorax (n-alkane degrader) and Cycloclasticus (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degrader) were rapidly enriched only in NSC conditions. Both the strong correlation between Oleispira SSU gene copies and oil concentration, and the specificity of the Oleispira assay suggest that this organism is a robust bioindicator for seawater contaminated by petroleum in cold water environments. Further optimization for automation of the Oleispira assay for in situ analysis with a genosensing device is underway. The assay for Colwellia quantification requires more specificity to fewer Colwellia OTUs and a well-established dose-response relationship before those taxa are used for oil tracking purposes.

M.; Ramirez-Monsalve, Paulina","In the North Sea, many oil and gas fields will reach the end of their productivity and their associated structures will be decommissioned. OSPAR decision 98/3 prescribes removal of all disused offshore structures as the only acceptable decommissioning option. This policy is the legacy of the 1995 Brent Spar incident, which resulted in the current dominant discourse of 'Hands off the Oceans,' ruling out the conversion of oil and gas rigs into artificial reefs (Rigs-to-Reefs (RtR)). The shift from a conservation to a restoration paradigm could open up the RtR debate. In this paper, a discourse analysis is carried out to discern whether and how ideas about RtR and ecosystem restoration are articulated to challenge the dominant 'Hands off the Oceans' discourse and thereby bring about change in North Sea decommissioning policy. A discourse analytic framework is applied to elucidate whether an 'RtR as Restoration' discourse can be distinguished and how competing claims are presented in the various storylines. Our analysis shows an 'RtR as Restoration' discourse, consisting of four different storylines. Given the fragmented nature of this discourse, the 'RtR as Restoration' discourse will not overcome the dominant 'Hands off the Oceans' discourse.",0.424
